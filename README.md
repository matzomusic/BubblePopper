# BubblePopper

### Hover over to pop bubbles. 
### The score for bubbles is the radius ^ 2. 
### The score for exploding bubbles is the radius ^ 3 plus any neighbors' score. 
### After a while the bubbles turn red and the bubble will give you a negative score, but you'll want to pop them because they turn lethal eventually!
#### Each level brings new surprises.
