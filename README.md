# BubblePopper

### Hover over to pop bubbles. 
### The score for bubbles is the radius ^ 2. 
### The score for exploding bubbles is the radius ^ 3 plus any neighbors' score. 
### After a while the bubbles turn red and the bubble will give you a negative score, but you'll want to pop them because they turn lethal eventually!
#### Since the bigger the bubble, the higher the score, instead of just spamming the mouse it's better to wait for larger bubbles to form, and clear the way by popping the non growing bubbles. 
#### Each level brings new surprises.
